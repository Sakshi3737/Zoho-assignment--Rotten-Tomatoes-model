# Zoho-assignment--Rotten-Tomatoes-model
I built a simple Rotten Tomatoes-style review sentiment analysis model, we can use machine learning to predict whether a review is positive or negative. Below is an example using Python and a machine learning approach with the scikit-learn library.

This code demonstrates how to:

1. Load a dataset.
2. Preprocess the data (text reviews).
3. Train a model to classify the reviews as positive or negative.
4. Evaluate the model.
